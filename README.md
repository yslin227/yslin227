# About

I am an AML Data Analyst with nearly five years of hands-on banking experience, specializing in tuning transaction monitoring and sanctions screening systems to reduce false positives and improve operational efficiency. I bridge compliance and technology by applying data science, SQL, and Python to build scalable, data-driven solutions for financial crime prevention.

Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science at the University of Maryland, where I focus on machine learning and NLP applications for real-world problems.

In the short term, I aim to contribute to companies developing AML products. In the long run, I seek to leverage AI-driven approaches to make AML systems more accurate, adaptable, and less operationally burdensome for end users.

# Projects

## AgrorithmFarm  

### Multi-type File Generator for LLM Training (LLM, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Web Design, Visualization)

Designed for the Capital Area Food Bank (CAFB), AgrorithmFarm is an interactive Streamlit-based application that enables users to generate high-quality content including blog posts, PowerPoint presentations, YouTube transcripts, grant proposals, and marketing collateral. The system supports file uploads, URL ingestion, and manual prompts, and integrates Large Language Models (LLMs), image captioning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and dynamic slide generation into a unified workflow that automates content transformation and reduces manual effort.

## WNUT17 GPT-based NER Benchmark  

### Prompt-based NER Benchmark on WNUT 2017 (LLM, NLP, Prompting, Evaluation)

Developed as a research-oriented benchmark, this project evaluates GPT-style prompt-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the WNUT 2017 Emerging and Rare Entity dataset, focusing on how well large language models handle noisy, informal text and hard-to-detect entity types. The repository provides a reproducible workflow for running zero-shot and few-shot experiments, standardizing model outputs, evaluating performance with precision, recall, and F1 metrics, and conducting error analysis on boundary mistakes, entity type confusion, and prompt-induced false positives.
